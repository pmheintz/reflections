When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I'd use a remote repo when I am collaborating with others on a project, or just
    to be able to access a project on multiple machines. For instance, if I'm
    working on a project on school computers, my macbook, laptop, and/or desktop.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Probably the biggest reason not to automatically pull is when other people are
    contributing to the repo. An automatic pull might pull a branch that someone
    else has modified that I might not want to work on at the moment, thus throwing
    off my coding.
